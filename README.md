This project is an exercise in interacting with a database through a node file on the back end. It contains a schema and seed file to produce a small database with three tables and the app itself will prompt you for info and allow you to view the info currently in the database or search for specific groups of data, as well as add to the tables and update existing rows! please find a gif and link to full video below!
